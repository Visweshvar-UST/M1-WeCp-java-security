Implementing library management using Spring JPA and Security
Problem Statement
The government is building a centralized library management system which involves a micro-service, allowing people to issue books and return them at the right time.



Library management requires creating users and renewing user subscriptions via authenticated processes. Secure create-user and renew-user-subscription APIs with Spring Security. The API issue-book should be permitted for everyone. This micro-service should be built using the Spring Boot REST API framework and it should connect to the database using the JPA API and secure methods using Spring Security.



In this task, implement three APIs for which the details are given below:



/api/v1/create-user [POST]: Simple user save method in an authenticated manner
/api/v1/issue-book [POST]: Send issue, check if users subscribed(see subscribed field in User entity), otherwise throw SubscriptionExpiredException- permitAll
/api/v1/renew-user-subscription/{id} [GET]: Send userId, set user subscription to true in an authenticated manner.




Your task is to complete the files given below:

src/main/java/com/wecp/library/controller/LibraryController.java
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/security/WebSecurityConfigurer.java
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/repository/UserRepository.java
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/repository/IssueRepository.java




You can find blank jpa repositories here:

src/main/java/com/wecp/library/repository/UserRepository.java
src/main/java/com/wecp/library/repository/IssueRepository.java




Notes:

Implementation related specifics are added directly as javadocs in the workspace.
Ensure that the structure and datatypes of the APIs are followed as specified in the comments to ensure that the code is evaluated correctly.
